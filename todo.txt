Scheduler todo

Bugs:

todo:
in table view, change delete to a dropdown list edit/delete
update instructions in "how do I use this"
move config.php data to db, in support of multiple events
make action and show buttons consisten style (all buttons I guess)
show selection count?
visualizer in a separate window, and real time reflection of changes
add (at least) simple callsign validation to try to keep the junk out of the password table
allow a station co-operator
add admin column to user table; add "make admin" function to admin page; verify admin login to use admin page.
maybe: make entering call/name optional when only browsing
handle enter key to show just my schedule, or maybe just log in

admin screen, admin users

Done:
in resulting schedule table day of week is correct but dates are all the same, ending date
move time_opts and day_opts to config.php
selecting all doesn't work
default checked state of "all" on initial load isn't working
checkbox states are not preserved from post to post
uncheck "all" if some other boxes checked
deletes not working.... delete has correct date and time but has band & mode 
   from last scheduled line in db - which may not even be displayed!
logout happens when it shouldn't
dynamic checkboxes still not perfect; on initial load, if check a choice, all does not go off
delete/add checkboxes should not show if delete/add button not also shown
make behavior of ALL selection consistent
externalize time range definitions
if logged in, clicking a show button logs out (and otherwise does the right thing)
adding to schedule without password not possible (no button)
reinstate checkboxes for band and mode, with the effect of narrowing the list of choices in the dropdown
"all" should not be in dropdowns for band/mode
can't create new passwords!!
create a (hidden) admin page that can wipe the db or create a new one
apply new normalizer causes logout
make heatmap work
close visualizer popup when click outside
make login style on scheduler the same as on visualizer
better tooltip management
show mine and open slots button
after logged in, op_name and op_call are no longer passed to code, it errors out 
ical export
slot_edit popup better size and moveable
hover over visualizer grid shows summary of what's in it
slot_edit can now edit existing entry
include event name and other details in ical export
link visualizer to main scheduler
logged in status is maintained across GET from scheduler to visualizer
moved db password to a file of its own (secrets.php) outside of public_html to protect that password

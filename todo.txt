Scheduler todo

Bugs:

delete/add checkboxes should not show if delete/add button not also shown

todo:
show days with date
uncheck "all" if some other boxes checked
color odd/even lines

make behavior of ALL selection consistent
externalize time range definitions
admin screen, admin users
limit displayed result to xxx (from config) - unless using show all scheduled
a station should not be able to reserve the same time slot for more than one band/mode
re-display table after add/delete
if logged in, clicking a show button logs out (and otherwise does the right thing)
type call+name press enter fetches the call's current schedule
adding to schedule without password not possible (no button)

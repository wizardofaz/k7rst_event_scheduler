Scheduler todo

Bugs:


todo:
add admin column to user table; add "make admin" function to admin page; verify admin login to use admin page.
maybe: make entering call/name optional when only browsing
handle enter key to show just my schedule, or maybe just log in
change delete to a dropdown list edit/delete
make heatmap work

admin screen, admin users
type call+name press enter fetches the call's current schedule

Done:
in resulting schedule table day of week is correct but dates are all the same, ending date
move time_opts and day_opts to config.php
selecting all doesn't work
default checked state of "all" on initial load isn't working
checkbox states are not preserved from post to post
uncheck "all" if some other boxes checked
deletes not working.... delete has correct date and time but has band & mode 
   from last scheduled line in db - which may not even be displayed!
logout happens when it shouldn't
dynamic checkboxes still not perfect; on ititial load, if check a choice, all does not go off
delete/add checkboxes should not show if delete/add button not also shown
make behavior of ALL selection consistent
externalize time range definitions
if logged in, clicking a show button logs out (and otherwise does the right thing)
adding to schedule without password not possible (no button)
reinstate checkboxes for band and mode, with the effect of narrowing the list of choices in the dropdown
"all" should not be in dropdowns for band/mode
can't create new passwords!!
create a (hidden) admin page that can wipe the db or create a new one

Scheduler todo

Bugs:

delete/add checkboxes should not show if delete/add button not also shown
logout happens when it shouldn't

todo:
uncheck "all" if some other boxes checked
make heatmap work

make behavior of ALL selection consistent
externalize time range definitions
admin screen, admin users
if logged in, clicking a show button logs out (and otherwise does the right thing)
type call+name press enter fetches the call's current schedule
adding to schedule without password not possible (no button)

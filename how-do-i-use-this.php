<h1>How Do I Use This?</h1>

<p>This page will help you understand how to use the CACTUS Operator Scheduling Tool to sign up for operating time during the special event.</p>

<h2>1. Signing In</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enter your <strong>callsign</strong> and <strong>name</strong> at the top of the page.</li>
    <li>If you'd like to protect your schedule with a password, enter it. Once used, you‚Äôll need it in the future.</li>
	<li><strong>Note: </strong>The password only protects against others deleting or adding to your schedule. 
		Browsing anything in the schedule is not secured.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Finding Available Slots</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Select the <strong>bands</strong> and <strong>modes</strong> you are interested in using.</li>
    <li>Choose a date range, time of day, and which days of the week you're available.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>‚ÄúShow Mine and Unscheduled‚Äù</strong> to see matching open slots, 
		as well as any slots you have already scheduled.</li>
	<li>The other two choices can show you everything currently scheduled 
		<strong>(Show All Scheduled Slots)</strong>, or just your own schedule 
		<strong>(Show Mine Only)</strong>. 
		These may be of interest for printing or otherwise saving the schedule.</li>
    <li>Note: If you've clicked several "All" choices, and you choose 
		<strong>‚ÄúShow Mine and Unscheduled‚Äù</strong>, the resulting table can be very large. 
		Checking all of the "All" choices creates a table of about 10,000 lines. 
		Consider limiting your search to something manageable, or using one of 
		buttons that does not include open slots.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Booking Your Time</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In the list of results, you‚Äôll see each slot‚Äôs date, time, band, and mode.</li>
    <li>Click the checkboxes for any slots you want to book.</li>
    <li>Optionally choose a <strong>club station</strong> if you'll be using one ‚Äî only one person can reserve a club station per time slot.</li>
    <li>Add any optional notes you'd like to include with your booking.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>‚ÄúAdd Selected Slots‚Äù</strong> to finalize your signup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Viewing or Deleting Your Schedule</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To see only your scheduled slots, click <strong>‚ÄúShow My Schedule Only.‚Äù</strong></li>
    <li>Your slots will appear with a ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù option. Check the ones you want to remove and click <strong>‚ÄúDelete Selected Slots.‚Äù</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Printing or Downloading</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You can print your schedule directly by clicking the <strong>üñ®Ô∏è Print Schedule</strong> button.</li>
    <li>To export your schedule as a CSV file (spreadsheet-compatible), use the <strong>‚¨áÔ∏è Download CSV</strong> button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using a Club Station</h2>

<div style="border: 2px solid #5cb85c; background-color: #e6f9e6; padding: 1em; border-radius: 6px;">
    <p>
        If you plan to operate from one of the shared <strong>club stations</strong>, you can reserve it when booking your slot.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select a club station from the <strong>‚ÄúClub Station‚Äù</strong> dropdown in the form.</li>
        <li>If left blank, we assume you're using your own personal station.</li>
        <li><strong>Only one operator</strong> can use a specific club station in a given hour ‚Äî it's exclusive.</li>
        <li>If a time slot is already taken for that club station, you'll need to pick a different time or station.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you're unsure, leave it blank. You can always update your schedule later (by delete/add).</p>

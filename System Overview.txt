CACTUS Scheduler System Description

Overview
The CACTUS Scheduler is a web-based scheduling system designed for amateur radio 
operators participating in a special event hosted by the Radio Society of Tucson (K7RST). 
The event activates multiple callsigns — each representing a different cactus species
 — and invites hams to reserve operating time across various bands and modes.

The system allows operators to:

View existing schedules.

Select available time slots.

Optionally reserve a club station.

Add personal notes to each booking.

Manage (add/delete) their own scheduled slots.

Password use is optional — and only required for making changes after a password is 
initially set. Browsing and viewing schedules does not require login or a password.

Key Functional Features
Operator Inputs and Filtering
Operators specify what part of the schedule they want to browse to see existing 
schedule and openings, and optionally, claim one or more open slots. The form 
includes:

Callsign (required, uppercased)

Name (required)

Password (optional; required only if previously set, and only for adding/deleting scheduled slots)

Operators can filter slots using:

Bands – selectable checkboxes (with “All” option)

Modes – selectable checkboxes (with “All” option)

Date Range – select start and end date; one date implies a single day

Time Ranges – four daily blocks (Midnight–6am, 6am–Noon, etc.) + “All”

Days of the Week – checkboxes (Mon–Sun + “All”)

Two optional fields can be specified during the claiming of a previously open slot:

Club Station – dropdown per-slot (from a list defined in config)

Notes – freeform notes per-slot

Scheduling and Views
Views are always filtered by choices of band, mode, day, and time ranges. 
Operators can:

Show Available Slots: open slots + ones already booked by the current user

Show My Schedule Only: only bookings by this operator

Show All Scheduled Slots: all current bookings

Download CSV or Print the resulting table

Each result displays in a table showing:

Callsign (for currently booked slots)

Name (for currently booked slots)

Date, Time, Band, Mode

Club Station (if any), Notes (if any)

Status (open/booked by user/booked by others)

If a slot is booked by the current user, it's highlighted and can be deleted. Open slots show dropdown/select fields for Club Station and Notes.

Database Structure
schedule Table
id (auto-increment)

date, time (hourly granularity)

operator_passwords Table
op_call (primary key)

Password Behavior
No password is needed for viewing or browsing schedules.

First-time users can set a password by entering one during booking.

Once set, the password must be used for any future schedule changes.

Passwords are stored in the operator_passwords table.

Successfully authenticated callsigns are stored in the PHP session for 2 hours of inactivity.

Session-based login is indicated with a green success message (displays for only 5 seconds) 
and a Logout button (replaces password field).

Clicking Logout destroys the session and resets the form.

Technical Notes
Built using PHP and MySQL.

A small config.php file externalizes the following:
List of bands
List of modes
List of club station choices 
For accessing the database: DB server, DB name, login name, password

Sessions are configured for 2 hours of idle timeout.

All callsigns are normalized to uppercase.

The UI uses standard HTML and CSS (with some JavaScript for checkbox helpers and popups).

A “How Do I Use This?” help page is linked from the main screen.
